# MQTT topics

RTL-HAOS publishes **Home Assistant MQTT Discovery** configs (retained) plus state topics (also retained).

## Availability

- `home/status/rtl_bridge<ID_SUFFIX>/availability`
  - payloads: `online` / `offline`

`ID_SUFFIX` is empty by default. If `FORCE_NEW_IDS=true`, it becomes `_v2` (see `config.py`).

## State topics

Sensor/binary-sensor state is published to:

- `home/rtl_devices/<clean_id>/<field>`

Where:

- `<clean_id>` is the device id from `rtl_433` normalized for MQTT/HA (see `utils.clean_mac`).
- `<field>` is the flattened field name (e.g., `temperature`, `humidity`, `rssi`, `snr`, `radio_status_101`).

State messages are published with `retain=True` so Home Assistant can restore values on restart.

## Home Assistant MQTT Discovery

Discovery configs are published (retained) to:

- `homeassistant/<domain>/<unique_id>/config`

Where:

- `<domain>` is usually `sensor`, but some fields publish as other domains:
  - `battery_ok` is published as a `binary_sensor` with device_class `battery` (ON = low).
- `<unique_id>` is built from `<clean_id>_<field><ID_SUFFIX>`.

Discovery payloads include:

- `state_topic` (points at `home/rtl_devices/<clean_id>/<field>`)
- `availability_topic` (points at the bridge availability topic)
- `expire_after` (defaults to `RTL_EXPIRE_AFTER`)

## Maintenance command topics

RTL-HAOS publishes two HA buttons under the **Bridge** device. When pressed, Home Assistant sends commands to:

- `home/status/rtl_bridge<ID_SUFFIX>/nuke/set` (Delete Entities; press 5x)
- `home/status/rtl_bridge<ID_SUFFIX>/restart/set` (Restart Radios)

## Entity cleanup ("Delete Entities")

The cleanup routine subscribes to `homeassistant/+/+/config` and deletes retained discovery configs where the discovery payload has `device.manufacturer` containing `rtl-haos`.

If you run multiple RTL-HAOS bridges on the same broker, this cleanup can remove discovery entries for all of them.
